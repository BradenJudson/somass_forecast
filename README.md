# Somass River temperature forecasting project

Time series analyses of weekly Somass River temperature data. 

The directory `clim` analyses relationships between large-scale climatic variables and summer conditions in the Somass River. These analyses identify weak relationships between average summer river temperatures and several climatic indices, including the [Pacific Northwest Index](https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/pni). 

This script also forecasts future river temperatures using seasonal trends among the historical data and current and projected air temperature estimates.
